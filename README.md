## Getting Started

To install the required dependencies, you're gonna run `npm install` in all three folders of this project
- `/server`
- `/client`
- `/cronjob`


For this app to work properly you need to add cronjobs to your ubuntu server.
## TODO GIVE BETTER DIRECTIVES FOR CRONJOBS OR FIND A BETTER ALTERNATIVE
- open a terminal and type `crontab -e`
- on the last line of the file add this line `*/10 * * * * node pathToThisProject/cronjob/index.js`

The database and the server must be running for the cronjob to work properly.

Start the server from the `/server` folder with `npx nodemon index.js`

Start the client side with `npm start`

## Tech Stack

The front-end framework is **React.js**

The back-end server is **Koa**
